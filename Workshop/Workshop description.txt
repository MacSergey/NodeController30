[code][h1]Overview[/h1]
[list][h2]This mod allows you change node type and shape[/h2][/list]
[/code]

This is renewal version of original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2085403475]Node Controller[/url] by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198109315306/myworkshopfiles/]kian.zarrin[/url] with improved UI/UX.
The new UI allows you to make the perfect intersection with just a few clicks.

Node Controller Renewal supports importing original Node Controller data, but not completely. Some intersections may require manual adjustment. 
To start use Node Controller Renewal you should disable original Node Controller and subscribe to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2040656402]Harmony[/url]
[code]
[h3][b]WARNING[/b]: If you import data from original Node Controller and make new save, you will no longer be able to use the original Node Controller on this map.[/h3]

[h1]Support[/h1]
If you have any problems with mod or errors occur, you should describe your problem as much detailed as possible, comments like “mod does not work” will be ignored.
Also, you should provide the game log, comments about errors without game log will be ignored too. Read [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=463645931]here[/url] how to share log. 

Although, the best way to solve problems is joining to my discord and write to [b]#Support[/b] channel, unfortunately, steam comments is very useless for conversation.
